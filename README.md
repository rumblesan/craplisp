Crap Lisp
=========

It's a lisp interpreter, just a pretty crappy one.

Info
----

I decided to write a Lisp interpreter, because it seemed like fun. It's written in python but I'll probably rewrite it in something more fun later.

Features
--------

* Crappy error handling
* Low speed
* Interpreter IN YOUR INTERPRETER
* Basic math functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
* Greater than, less than, equals operators
* Basic boolean operators
* No Floats
